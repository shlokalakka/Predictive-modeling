🔍 Process Breakdown

1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
Data Importation: The dataset is loaded into the environment for analysis.​
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Initial analysis is performed to understand the data distribution, identify missing values, and detect outliers.​
Data Cleaning: Missing values are handled appropriately, and irrelevant features are removed to streamline the dataset.​
Feature Engineering: New features are created based on existing ones to enhance the model's predictive power.​
2. Model Development
Baseline Models: Several machine learning models are trained individually, such as:​
Linear Regression​
Decision Trees​
Random Forests​
Gradient Boosting Machines​
Model Evaluation: Each model's performance is evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²) to determine their effectiveness.​
3. Model Stacking
Stacked Ensemble: The predictions from the baseline models are combined using a meta-model (e.g., a linear regression model) to form a stacked ensemble.​
Training the Meta-Model: The meta-model is trained on the outputs of the base models to learn how to best combine their predictions.​
Final Evaluation: The stacked model's performance is assessed to ensure it outperforms individual models.​
4. Results and Analysis
Performance Comparison: The stacked model's results are compared against the baseline models to highlight improvements.​
Visualization: Graphs and plots are used to visualize model performance and residuals.​
